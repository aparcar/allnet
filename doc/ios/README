this directory contains files needed to build a release for iOS under XCode.
The files are generally in .tar format, and labeled by date.  Generally,
most people will only be interested in the latest date.

other notes for iOS follow.

The main way to submit seems to be:
compile for "generic iOS device" (under Product/scheme)
archive (under File) and submit the archive to apple
log into itunesconnect.apple.com, select "My apps", follow the
  more-or-less intuitive procedure.

2016/06/06: announcement of the development of the software was done to
cryp@bis.doc.gov and enc@nsa.gov.  The two websites listed are alnt.org
and sourceforge.net/project/allnet/ Stated my belief that the software is
exempt under EAR 740.13(e), which covers open-source software distributed
through the Internet.
